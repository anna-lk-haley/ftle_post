Takes in BSL Solver files in h5 format and spits out the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field. Can adjust integration time but settings are currently hard-coded. A script for postprocessing the field into a movie of a slice of the field (would be better as a volume render but oh well) is also included. Scripts are written by Anna Haley - ahaley@mie.utoronto.ca
